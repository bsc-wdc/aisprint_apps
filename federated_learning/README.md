# Federated Learning
The application contained in this folder creates an AI model using Federeated Learning. Unlike other applications, which have a centralized training dataset, this version pursues training the model using multiple datasets hosted in different institutions without need of transferring them and, hence, faouring the privacy of the data collected by each institution. In this case, each institution trains a RandomForest model from the dataset available in it. The model trained by each institution is transferred to a central institution which merges all the models to create a single model.
